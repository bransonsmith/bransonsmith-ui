# Branson Smith Ui
[https://www.bransonsmith.dev](https://www.bransonsmith.dev)

This React app is a portfolio of some of my dev work, resume, and also home to some projects for fun. 

There are a variety of backends this app can hit, depending on what I'm working on at home at the time.
Most stuff will live in AWS Lambda Functions behind an AWS API Gateway that is maintained independently of this React app.

The app generally uses Tailwind Css, which I prefer these days, but includes some modules that use plain css, and even some react styling when I wanted to get some Js involved.

This project was created using Vite.

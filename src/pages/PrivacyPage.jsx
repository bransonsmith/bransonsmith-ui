        <h2>Information Collection</h2>

        <p>Your email and public profile information are shared via Google Single Sign-On for account creation and identification.</p>
        <h3>Usage Data:</h3> 
        <p>Information on how the Services are accessed and used (basically what actions you take while signed in) may be collected and correlated to an id.</p>

        <h3>Account Management:</h3>
         <p>Your information is used for managing your user account.</p>
        <h3>Authorization:</h3>

        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>I do not give away, sell, or rent your personal information. It may be shared if required by law.</p>

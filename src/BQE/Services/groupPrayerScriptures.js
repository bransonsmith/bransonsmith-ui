    1 Peter 1:17-2:3
    And if you address as Father the one who impartially judges according to each one’s work, live out the time of your temporary residence here in reverence. You know that from your empty way of life inherited from your ancestors you were ransomed—not by perishable things like silver or gold, but by precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, namely Christ. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for your sake. Through him you now trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
    You have purified your souls by obeying the truth in order to show sincere mutual love. So love one another earnestly from a pure heart. You have been born anew, not from perishable but from imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God. 
    For all flesh is like grass
    and all its glory like the flower of the grass;
    the grass withers and the flower falls off,
    but the word of the Lord endures forever.
    And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.

    
    So get rid of all evil and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. And yearn like newborn infants for pure (wordy), spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up to salvation, if you have experienced the Lord’s kindness.

    Isaiah 40: 6-26
    A voice says, “Cry out!”
Another asks, “What should I cry out?”
The first voice responds: “All people are like grass,
and all their promises are like the flowers in the field.
    The grass dries up,
the flowers wither,
when the wind sent by the Lord blows on them.
Surely humanity is like grass.
    The grass dries up,
the flowers wither,
but the decree of our God is forever reliable.”
    Go up on a high mountain, O herald Zion.
Shout out loudly, O herald Jerusalem!
Shout, don’t be afraid!
Say to the towns of Judah,
“Here is your God!”
    Look, the Sovereign Lord comes as a victorious warrior;
his military power establishes his rule.
Look, his reward is with him;
his prize goes before him.
    Like a shepherd he tends his flock;
he gathers up the lambs with his arm;
he carries them close to his heart;
he leads the ewes along.
    Who has measured out the waters in the hollow of his hand,
or carefully measured the sky,
or carefully weighed the soil of the earth,
or weighed the mountains in a balance,
or the hills on scales?
    Who comprehends the mind of the Lord,
or gives him instruction as his counselor?
    From whom does he receive directions?
Who teaches him the correct way to do things,
or imparts knowledge to him,
or instructs him in skillful design?
    Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
they are regarded as dust on the scales.
He lifts the coastlands as if they were dust.
    Not even Lebanon could supply enough firewood for a sacrifice;
its wild animals would not provide enough burnt offerings.
    All the nations are insignificant before him;
they are regarded as absolutely nothing.
    To whom can you compare God?
To what image can you liken him?
    A craftsman casts an idol;
a metalsmith overlays it with gold
and forges silver chains for it.
    To make a contribution one selects wood that will not rot;
he then seeks a skilled craftsman
to make an idol that will not fall over.
    Do you not know?
Do you not hear?
Has it not been told to you since the very beginning?
Have you not understood from the time the earth’s foundations were made?
    He is the one who sits on the earth’s horizon;
its inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him.
He is the one who stretches out the sky like a thin curtain,
and spreads it out like a pitched tent.
    He is the one who reduces rulers to nothing;
he makes the earth’s leaders insignificant.
    Indeed, they are barely planted;
yes, they are barely sown;
yes, they barely take root in the earth,
and then he blows on them, causing them to dry up,
and the wind carries them away like straw.
    “To whom can you compare me? Whom do I resemble?”
says the Holy One.
    Look up at the sky!
Who created all these heavenly lights?
He is the one who leads out their ranks;
he calls them all by name.
Because of his absolute power and awesome strength,
not one of them is missing.
